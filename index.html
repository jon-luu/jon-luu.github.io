        The affinity diagram highlights common student frustrations with physical Carolina Cards, such as losing or damaging them, carrying multiple cards, and facing limited scanner compatibility. It suggests creating a secure, all-in-one digital campus access app with features like NFC tap entry, QR code backup, and biometric authentication, which would streamline access, boost convenience, improve security, and make USC appear more modern and tech-forward.

These sketches outline the design flow of the One USC App, showing the login screen, student dashboard, Face ID verification, and final digital card access. They illustrate how users securely log in and use biometric authentication to conveniently access their Carolina Card for campus entry and payments.
